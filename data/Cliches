don't have the bandwidth
hit the ground running
The customer is always right
knock the ball outta the park
value-added proposition
cross that bridge when we get to it
put the cart before the horse
Fail to plan and plan to fail
Take it to the Next Level
Too many cooks in the kitchen
Moving up the value chain
Donâ€™t be afraid to fail
At the end of the day
